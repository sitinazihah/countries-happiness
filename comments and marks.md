### 91/100. Very nice work. Please find the comments below for details.
### Scores on each part
#### 1. Introduction and data description 
##### 5/5 The introduction is a nice read (very good `gif` at the beginning), including data descriptions, research questions and summary of findings. 
#### 2. Formulation of research question
##### 5/5 Very clear formulation of the objectives. 
#### 3. Data acquisition
##### 7.5/10 Through the use of web scraping, mainly based on the `pandas.read_html` function.  
#### 4. Data cleaning and reshaping
##### 26.5/30 Data cleaning and reshaping involves filling missing values, merging multiple datasets, adding some features, etc. These steps are well explained in detail. 
#### 5. Visualization
##### 29/30 Very nice plot (especially the correlation plot in code cell [19] and the boxplot in code cell [16]). Various plots including several interactive ones. Results are well-explained. 
#### 6. Data modelling
##### 8.5/10 The modelling part includes classification and principal component analysis. Visualization is used to better illustrate the results. Would be better to plot ROC curve for Section 6.2 and use different methods for model comparison.
#### 7. Conclusion and the overall structure 
##### 9.5/10 Very nice conclusion with discussion of further study (again, nice `gif`'s at the end). Thanks for the hard work!
